# What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)?
i tried using a variety of loaders and plugins to get the deployment working. I was even trying to make an  express server to host it on heroku, but the build kept timeing out on the webpack production building. 

# Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose?
<br>This was actually my first exposure to configuring webpack  I had a lot of trouble getting the provided server properly deployed which is why I made this React version as well as a vanilla HTML page.
<br> I could get the webpack dev server working well and looking as desired, but when it came time to deploy, I was a little confused on how to deploy properly and heroku kept timing out on my build, and my deployment it github was serving the original index.html without the bundles,  So I made the 2 versions (react and HTML).

# What you enjoyed the most and why?
It might be a cheesy answer, but, all of it. I loved looking at the mockup and provided sketch file. I loved making my own wireframes and HTML skeleton. I loved modularizing the HTML into react components. Programming and solving problems are just good times. I would have pushed through the problems with deploying the webpack site if I had more time, and will research webpack much more now. I felt like I was so close, and just needed to change a few small things, and it would deploy properly. Very Nice!
